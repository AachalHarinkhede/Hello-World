# Hello World Program Repository

Welcome to the **Hello World Program Repository**! This repository is a collection of "Hello World" programs written in various programming languages. The purpose of this project is to showcase the simplest code in different languages, help new learners, and give everyone an opportunity to contribute.

## How to Contribute

Follow the steps below to contribute your "Hello World" program:

1. **Choose a Language**  
   Pick any programming language that hasn't been added yet, or improve an existing one.

2. **Create a New File**  
   - Name your file according to the language you're using.  
     For example:
     - If you're writing in Python, name your file `hello_world.py`.
     - If you're writing in JavaScript, name your file `hello_world.js`.
     - If you're writing in Ruby, name your file `hello_world.rb`.

3. **Write Your Code**  
   Write your own unique "Hello World" program. Make sure the program follows best practices for the chosen language and is easy to understand for beginners.

4. **Add Comments**  
   Briefly explain your code with comments, especially if the syntax is unique or the language is less known. This helps new learners grasp the concepts more easily.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Once you're done, submit a pull request with your code. Please provide a short description of the language and any important details about the implementation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to contribute:

1. Create a file named `hello_world.py` if you're writing in Python.
2. Write your code:
   ```python
   # Python Hello World
   print("Hello, World!")
3. Add comments to explain what the code does.
4. Submit your pull request.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Make sure the file extension matches the programming language you're using.
- Use clear and concise code, following best practices for your chosen language.
- Avoid submitting identical versions of "Hello World" programs that are already in the repository. Try to add something unique if possible.
- Keep the code simple and beginner-friendly.
